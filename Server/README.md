# ChatApp — Server (Server)

This folder contains the backend for ChatApp.

Key points
- Location: `Server/`
- Main file: `index.js`
- Package manifest: `Server/package.json`

What this README covers
- Basic assumptions about how to run the server locally
- Typical environment variables
- Example API notes and CORS recommendation

Quick setup and run
1. Ensure Node.js (14+) and npm are installed.
2. From the `Server` folder install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
# from project root
cd Server
npm install
# start via npm script or directly with node
npm start    # if package.json has a start script
# or
node index.js
```

Environment variables
- PORT — optional port to bind the server (default used in code if not set). Common value: `5000`.
- If the server connects to a database or a third-party service, define the corresponding env vars in a `.env` file and load them with your preferred loader.

Frontend integration
- Allow CORS from the frontend origin (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) so the Vite dev server can call the API during local development. If CORS isn't enabled, add it in `index.js` (for Express, use the `cors` package and allow `process.env.FRONTEND_ORIGIN` or `http://localhost:5173`).

API notes (example placeholders)
- GET / => health or root message
- POST /auth/login => login (example)
- POST /messages => post a message
- GET /messages?channel=... => retrieve channel messages

These endpoints are examples given the repository layout. Update this section with the exact routes from `index.js` if they differ.

Assumptions and next steps
- I assumed `index.js` is the server entry and that `package.json` contains a `start` script. If the repository uses a different structure (e.g., `src/`), please update the README accordingly.
- If you'd like, I can read `Server/index.js` and update the API endpoints and the exact start script to match what's present.

Security and deployment notes
- Never commit secrets. Use environment variables or a secrets manager in production.
- For production, use a process manager (pm2, systemd) or containerization (Docker) and handle logging/monitoring.

Contributing
- Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger or markdown) when adding/changing endpoints.

License
- Inherit the repository's license (check root `LICENSE` or `package.json`).
